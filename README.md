`ExtractEmails.vba`
[extract emails](https://github.com/adgedenkers/office_vba_code/blob/main/ExtractEmails.vba)

This code finds all messages from a specific sender, wtih a given subject. Then it extracts the date sent, full subject, and text of the body of the message. 

For each email, it creates a local text file, named with the date the email was received. The first line of the file is the Subject of the email, followed by the text from the email body.
